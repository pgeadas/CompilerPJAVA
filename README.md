## CompilerPJAVA
This project consisted in developing a compiler for a simplified version of JAVA (normal JAVA, but without the OO component), and it was written in C.

The program yacc and lex files are called "mycalc.y" and "mycalc.l". 

This project was developed during my graduation (at University of Coimbra, Portugal) and it was made in collaboration with another colleague.
