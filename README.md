This project consisted in developing a compiler for a simplified version of JAVA (normal JAVA, but without the OO component), and it was
written in C.
#
The program yacc and lex files are called "mycalc.y" and "mycalc.l". The reason behind this, was because the original project was an arithmetic calculator, which was then used as basis to build this larger project. 
#
This project was developed during my graduation and it was made in collaboration with another colleague.
